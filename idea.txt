Essays are really important to school. However, finding reputable sources is something that students may struggle with. I hope to create a website that students can use which will list them a couple of reputable sources which they can use. For this project to work, I needed a way to gather a bunch of websites and then eliminate them if they were found to be unreliable. To do this, I started at wikipedia. Wikipedia is a great way to learn about a topic, but a lot of teachers may claim it to be unreliable. Therefore, I will still recommend it, but it is up to the user's choice to use the sources provided. After wikipedia, we will look at the references section of the wikipedia page. Then we will go through those references and check for reliable suffixes (.com, .edu, .gov).  All other sources will be removed. Then, we will go through the remaining sources and make sure the user would have access, the website is still functional, or if any other error occurs. The final list of websites will then be presented to the user. I hope to work on effeciency of the website as it takes a while to go through and check the status of each website.
